# Oxdoc 1.2beta

oxdoc is a tool for generating API documentation in HTML format from comments in Ox source code, inspired by Sun Microsystems' Javadoc. Ox is an object-oriented statistical matrix programming language.

Examples of generated documentation:

* [PcLiRE](http://yozw.github.io/oxdoc/pclire/default.html).
* [Niqlow](https://ferrall.github.io/niqlow/niqlow.ox.html) by Christopher Ferrall.

See http://yozw.github.io/oxdoc/ for example code and a user manual.

### Installation instructions (binaries)

The latest compiled version is available at https://github.com/yozw/oxdoc/releases.

#### Windows
* Unzip the binary zip file
* Use `oxdoc.bat` to run `oxdoc`
* You may want to copy `oxdoc.bat` to a directory in your path, e.g. 
  `c:\windows\system32`.  In that case, copy `oxdoc.jar` to the same
  directory.


#### Linux/OS X
* Unzip the binary zip file
* Activate execute permission for the oxdoc script in the `bin/` directory
* Edit `bin/oxdoc.xml`
* Run `bin/oxdoc`
* Alternatively, you can place oxdoc and oxdoc.jar in a directory in your path,
  e.g. `~/bin`  or  `/usr/local/bin`



### Compilation instructions
* Install ant; see https://ant.apache.org/.
* Run `ant build` to build Oxdoc.
* Run `ant dist` -- this will make zip files containing source and
  binary distributions in the `dist/` subdirectory

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Oxdoc freezes while running LaTeX

This happens sometimes when dvipng is run for the first time on files. In Windows, just use Ctrl+C to interrupt
the program and run oxdoc again. Usually, the problem then disappears.

### Formulas are not visible

This problem happens in Internet Explorer when you use transparent PNG files. The image files created by oxdoc
are semi-transparent PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files, and Internet Explorer does not support these files.
I recommend using Firefox instead.


###Â When parsing a line that contains two tranpose (') characters, oxdoc stops with an error message

Oxdoc stops with an error message when compiling Ox code that contains a line that contains two transpose (') characters with exactly one
character in between. Consider for example the following code:

```
mx = mx - meanc(mx')'
```

In this code, oxdoc erroneously recognizes the right parenthesis enclosed in two single quotes `')'` as a character constant and produces the following error message:

```
ParseException: Encountered " <IDENTIFIER> "pc1 "" at line 112, column 1.
Was expecting one of:
"decl" ...
"static" ...
"const" ...
"class" ...
"extern" ...
"enum" ...
"struct" ...
"static" ...
"extern" ...
"static" ...
```

The problem is caused by the fact that the ox language 'overloads' the single quote character.
In ox, it has two meanings: either it is the beginning of a character constant (e.g. 'x' or '\n' --
see also character constants in the Ox language manual), or it means taking the transpose of a vector.

**Workaround**

Although I have not been able to fix this issue completely, there is a simple workaround for the issue: adding an extra space
will prevent oxdoc from making a wrong judgment. (Remark: you need oxdoc version 0.991alpha or higher for this to work.)
So, replacing the code above by the following circumvents the problem:

```
mx = mx - meanc(mx' )'
```

Notice the extra space after the first single quote. Also note that, in this particular example, perhaps an even better solution is to write:

```
mx = mx - meanr(mx)
```  

## Version history

### August 2023 (oxdoc 1.2)
* This release aims to support new features in Ox 8 and Ox 9.
* Added support for `...varname` variable-length arguments.
* Added support for multiple variable declarations, e.g. `decl [a, b] = {1, 2}`.
* Allow `in` as a variable name.
* Added support for multiplicative matrix declaration, e.g. `enum{Vleng=3}; static decl zerovector = < [Vleng] *0>;`
* Added support for "raw string literals", i.e., multi-line strings surrounded by backtics.
* Added support for `.last` indexing in arrays.
* Added support for setting matrix dimensions in declaration, e.g., `decl x[3][3] = 1.5`.
* Added support for `decl` statement in `if` statement.
* Added support for `parallel if`.
* Added support for `.Null`.
* Errors in `oxdoc.xml` are no longer silently ignored.
* It is now possible to inject custom JavaScript by using the `-javascript` command line / configuration option.
* Bugfix: sort keys were ignored.
* Upgraded to MathJax 3.

### June 2017 (oxdoc 1.1)
* Updated `foreach` to allow for more complicated expressions
* Added `parallel for` and `serial`
* Updated case statement to allow for characters and strings

### March 4th, 2014
* Did a lot of refactoring and performance optimizations
* Oxdoc now automatically reads the "<filename>.oxdoc" file before processing "<filename>.ox" (if it exists).
Note that this happens only for main ".ox" files, and not for files that are included using the `#include` directive.
* Added an argument `-csspath` to specify where to find/write the css files.

### February 23rd, 2014
* Migrated to github
* Added a few unit tests
* Added support for new Ox 7 features: lambda expressions, the `foreach` keyword, and 
  default function argument values.
* Did some major refactoring and code cleaning
* Code now uses generics, so Java 5.0 or higher is required.

### April 4th, 2012
* Removed setup utility: not really necessary anymore because 
  Mathjax is default, and latex and dvipdfm are found on search path
* Refactored HTML output refactoring
* Added global variable support
* Enumeration elements are now in the index
* Removed AsciiMathML support
* Fixed GUI
* Beautified java code


### March 23rd, 2012
* Fixed the enumeration declaration problem (`enum { N=1, M =N+1}` is now parsed properly)
* Completed support for enumerations. Enumerations have no name in Ox, so they are 
  automatically called "Anonymous enumeration #1", etc. To suppress this behavior, 
  you can add an oxdoc comment before any enumeration, and use the `@name` tag to give 
  it a proper name. For example:

```
   /** Enumeration for feasilbility. 
       @name Feasibility **/
  enum { FEASIBLE, INFEASIBLE }
```

  The usual other `@` tags should work as well.

* Implemented indexing as per Chris Ferrall's suggestion: any overridden methods are
  placed on the same line.

* Added document to the output: the hierarchy tree. Notice that you need to update your 
  `oxdoc.css` to get this to work

* Changed the default oxdoc.css so that the output looks a bit prettier. At the same
  time, the HTML output is slightly different. The icons and texts in H1, H2, H3 headers
  are now inside SPANs.

* Implemented math display through Mathjax, as per suggestion of Michael Massman 
  (see http://www.mathjax.org/). Mathjax is superior to LaTeX image generation, but 
  it requires an internet connection. Since everybody these days has an internet connection, 
  this now the default behavior. You can still use LaTeX to generate formulas by specifying
  the option "-formulas latex". 

* Implemented automatic writing of auxiliary icons (for e.g. the tree, but also for 
  prettier output). If required icon files are not available, they are written. They are 
  never overwritten though. Icons are also on by default now. This can be disable by
  specifying `-noicons`

* Added an option `-uplevel` to enable the "up level" link.

* Implemented a `@sortkey` tag in all places. Every object has a sort key, which by default is
  the name of object (e.g. function name or class name), but which can be overridden by the 
  `@sortkey` tag. Objects are sorted according to their `@sortkey`s. In particular, this works
  for files, as you requested.

* The index now distinguishes between constructors, destructors, and methods.

* Default settings for Latex/dvipng executables now depend on the operating system.

* The `#import` command now includes appropriate header file
* The following code is no longer rejected:
  `[ a[1], a[2] ] = ... `
* Members are now listed in documentation too
* Ordering of private/protected/public in class definition is not fixed anymore
* Ordering of cases in switch should not be fixed (default comes last now)
* Add option to list members/methods as internal using `@internal`
* Member modifiers (e.g. static functions/fields, const fields) are documented as well now 
* Icons are now of the `icon` class in the output HTML
* Latex formulas are now of the `latex` class in the output HTML
* Improved css files / added Chris Ferrall's css file
* Added goto statement / labels to Ox syntax
* Added option for specifying include path 
* Added icon for fields / enumerations
* In PcLire, `Lire_Object` and `Lire_SimsSolver` have no icon in the index (fixed)
